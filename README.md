## Overview
For this project my aim was to make a random password generator that asks the user a series of questions to determine the characters they would like included in their password. This includes asking the length of the password required as well as asking which characters they would and would not like to be included. 

## Installation
In order to use this application, you will need to open it in the browser. You will then need to click the "Generate Password" button. You will then be presented with a series of options, starting with how long you would like your password to be, this will then be followed by asking which characters you would like included in the password. After you have selected all of these, you will be provided with a password that has matched your criteria. If you do not select any/enough features you will be asked to start again and you must begin again with the "Generate Password" button.

## Features
When starting the application, it will begin at the click of the "Generate Password" button. At this point you will be presented with a prompt, asking how many characters you would like your password to be. As you can see below:

 This must be within 8 and 128 characters, if not then you will be presented with an error message, as seen below:
